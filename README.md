# news-reader
Sample app using New API 

## Description

High level goal: build a news browser leveraging [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/).

Detailed goals below:

1. I need to be able to view a list of the latest news articles. For each article, I want to see:
    1. title
    2. source
    3. time of publishing
    4. description
    5. image (if available)
2. On the article list view, I need to be able to filter results by entering search keywords.
3. I need to be able to maintain a separate list of favorite articles (need to be able to add and remove).
4. (bonus) I want to be able to know which articles I already read (through some visual indicator distinguishing the read articles on the list view).
5. For any article, I need to be able to visit the source page.

At Butter, we look for people who appreciate the importance of craft and speed – and the balance thereof. Use your best judgment on how to accomplish the goals above!
